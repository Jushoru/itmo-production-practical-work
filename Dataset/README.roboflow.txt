The dataset includes 632 images.
Defects are annotated in Roboflow Server Benchmark Tool format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 1056x1056 (Fit within)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Random rotation of between -5 and +5 degrees
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -2 and +2 percent
